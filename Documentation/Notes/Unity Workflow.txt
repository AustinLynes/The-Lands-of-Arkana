Awake: 
    This function is always called before any Start functions and  also just after a prefab is 
    instantiated. 
    (If a GameObject is inactive during start up Awake is not called until it is made active.)

Start:
    Start is called before the first frame update only if the script instance is enabled.

Update: 
    Update is called once per frame. It is the main workhorse function for frame updates.
